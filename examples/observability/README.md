# Sending Traces and Metrics to the OpenTelemetry Collector

In this example, we will show you an example configuration for enabling the operator to send OpenTelemetry traces and metrics to the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector).
The Collector will then be used to forward the gathered data to [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

# TL;DR
* You can install the whole demo using: `make install`
* Deploy the PodTatoHead Demo Application: `make deploy-podtatohead`
* Afterward, see it in action as defined here: [OpenTelemetry in Action](#otel-in-action)

## Prerequisites:

This tutorial assumes that you have both Jaeger and the Prometheus Operator installed in your Cluster. 
Also, please ensure that the Prometheus Operator has the required permissions to watch resources of the `keptn-lifecycle-controller-system` namespace (see https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/kube/monitoring-other-namespaces/ as a reference).
For setting up both Jaeger and Prometheus, please refer to their docs:

- [Jaeger Setup](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator) 
- [Prometheus Operator Setup](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus/blob/main/docs/customizing.md)

If you don't have an already existing installation of Jaeger or Prometheus, you can run these commands to
have a basic installation up and running.

```shell

# Install Jaeger into the observability namespace and the Jaeger resource into the lifecycle-controller namespace
kubectl create namespace observability
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator/releases/download/v1.38.0/jaeger-operator.yaml -n observability
kubectl apply -f config/jaeger.yaml -n keptn-lifecycle-controller-system

# Install Prometheus
kubectl create namespace monitoring
kubectl apply --server-side -f config/prometheus/setup
kubectl apply -f config/prometheus/
```

With these commands, the Jaeger and Prometheus Operator will be installed in the `observability` and `monitoring` namespaces, respectively.

## Configuring the OpenTelemetry Collector and Prometheus ServiceMonitor

Once Jaeger and Prometheus are installed, you can deploy and configure the OpenTelemetry collector using the manifests in the `config` directory:

```sh 
kubectl apply -f config/otel-collector.yaml -n keptn-lifecycle-controller-system
```

Also, please ensure that the `OTEL_COLLECTOR_URL` env vars of both the `klc-controller-manager`, 
as well as the `keptn-scheduler` deployments are set appropriately. 
By default, they are set to `otel-collector:4317`, which should be the correct value for this tutorial.

Eventually, there should be a pod for the `otel-collector` deployment up and running:

```sh
$ kubectl get pods -lapp=opentelemetry -n keptn-lifecycle-controller-system

NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
otel-collector-6fc4cc84d6-7hnvp   1/1     Running   0             92m
```

When the `otel-collector` pod is up and running, restart the `keptn-scheduler` and `klc-controller-manager` so they can
pick up the new configuration.

```shell
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n keptn-lifecycle-controller-system keptn-scheduler klc-controller-manager
```

## Seeing the OpenTelemetry Collector in action {#otel-in-action}

After everything has been set up, use the lifecycle operator to deploy a workload (e.g. using the `single-service` or `podtato-head` example in the `examples` folder).
Once either of these examples have been deployed, you can view the generated traces in Jaeger. To do so, please create a port-forward for the `jaeger-query` service:

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n keptn-lifecycle-controller-system svc/jaeger-query 16686 
```

Afterwards, you can view the Jaeger UI in the browser at [localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686). There you should see the traces generated by the lifecycle controller, which should look like this:

**Trace details**

In Prometheus, do a port forward to the prometheus service inside your cluster (the exact name and namespace of the prometheus service will depend on your Prometheus setup - we are using the defaults that come with the example of the Prometheus Operator tutorial).

```sh
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-k8s 9090
```

Afterwards, you can view the Prometheus UI in the browser at [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090). There, in the [Targets](http://localhost:9090/targets?search=) section, you should see an entry for the otel-collector:

![](./assets/prometheus_targets.png)

Also, in the [Graph](http://localhost:9090/graph?g0.expr=&g0.tab=1&g0.stacked=0&g0.show_exemplars=0&g0.range_input=1h) section, you can retrieve metrics reported by the Keptn Lifecycle Controller (all of the available metrics start with the `keptn` prefix):
